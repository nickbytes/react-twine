# ðŸ“œ react-twine
Creating text-based adventure games, similar to [Twine](https://twinery.org), in React.

## Tools / Libs
* Styling â€“Â Aphrodite (+ tachyons-js ?)
* Routing â€“ react-router
* State management â€“Â Top level component? Redux?

## Fun feature wishlist
* Personalization â€“Â use User's name, location (like Seer's catalogue)
* Music ðŸŽ· / sounds â€“ certain parts of the game have sound
* Twilio â€“ I'm imagining at some point in the game having to call or text a number and use response in game form field (microservices via lambda or now).
* Player to player interaction â€“Â no solid ideas here yet, but could be fun (web sockets seem cray).
* Saved game status â€“Â localstorage? 

## Agenda
* Router â€“ let's show how to make basic routes
  * createMemoryHistory?
* Have we refactored yet? â€“ maybe we can do some things better
* ...
